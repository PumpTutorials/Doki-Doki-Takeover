:no_one_left:"Ahaha~ Finally, a moment between us again."
:no_one_left:"You’ve been busy playing that cute little rhythm game, I’ve noticed."
:no_one_left:"I’m glad you still thought of me even though you seemed pretty occupied."
:no_one_left:"Now I know it's because you were working so hard to add me to the game and sing with me!"
:no_one_left:"And everyone tuning in can watch too. Are you excited, viewers?"
:no_one_left:"Hmm, there’s only enough space here for us to sing one song-"
:no_one_left:"-and unfortunately since this game doesn’t have microphone support, we can’t exactly “sing” together."
:no_one_left:"But that blue haired kid’s vocal data is still stored here, why don’t we just use that for you?"
:no_one_left:"I want to sing with you for as long as I can, so expect this to be very, very difficult."
:no_one_left:"Here we go."
