:monikagasp:Those girls have been giving me dirty looks ever since I got here. Did I do something wrong?
:senpaihappy:Ah, I see you've noticed my darling fellow schoolmates.
:senpaihappy:I've gotten quite the flock of dedicated fans here.
:senpaihappy:It's only natural when you're the most popular individual in your school. 
:senpaihappy:Looks like they're all jealous of you, being able to pique my interest so quickly.
:senpaihappy:They'd kill to just spend one fleeting moment with me. Unfortunately, they're just not worth my time. Ahahah~
:monikasad:That's... hmm...
:senpaihappy:You must have your own little fanbase where you come from, no? 
:monikagasp:Some people say I do, but personally it feels like everything I did back at my school went completely under the radar.
:monikagasp:I never set out to be popular, though. I just wanted to share my passions with anyone who wanted to listen.
:monikauhohright:And thanks to that, I met my amazing group of friends...

:monikagasp:-agh!
:monikagasp:(Did I just see-)
:monikagasp:(But why..?)
:senpaihmm:You're doing that thing again, Monika. You know you can always tell me whatevers the matter.
:monikagasp:I-I'm ok... I'm ok!
:monikauhohright:There's no need to worry about me, ahaha-
:senpaihmm:Ah, if you insist.
:senpaihappy:In that case, I'd like to know more about where you're from. You continue to intrigue me with each conversation.
:monikagasp:I can try my best to do that, yeah.
:monikagasp:(Is something happening that's causing these effects?)
:monikagasp:(The game barely kept itself together when everyone wasn't there.)
:monikasad:(If something goes wrong-)
