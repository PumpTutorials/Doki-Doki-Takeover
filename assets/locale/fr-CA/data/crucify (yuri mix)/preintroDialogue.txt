:mc_neutral:"So, you two must be the other members that Monika and the other girls keep mentioning."
:mc_neutral:"They seem to know you quite well, even though I haven't seen either of you at a club meeting before."
:mc_sigh:"Well, I guess I did get roped into this whole Literature Club thing not too long ago, must've missed when you were around."
:mc_neutral:"I'm glad you showed up today though. Your whole singing thing has had the club really inspired."
:mc_neutral:"For the school festival later today, they decided to sing live as their club's special activity."
:mc_sigh:"Not sure what singing has to do with literature, but everyone seemed on board. Can't be upset at it, though."
:mc_happy:"I haven't seen Sayori this happy in a while."
:mc_happy:"I haven't had to go out of my way to wake her up for school nearly as much as I do, she's right outside with a happy smile waiting for me, humming happy tunes."
:mc_sigh:"But if you guys didn't show up, I would've had to be the one to sing with them. I'm not ready to embarrass myself in front of my peers like that yet."
:mc_camera:"Plus, none of them could even figure out a song they wanted to duet."
:mc_neutral:"You think you guys can help them out?"
:gf_yeah:*happy gesture*
:bf_yeah_left:"Beep!"
:mc_happy:"A whole backlog of songs? That should give them all a nice selection to choose from."
:mc_camera:"I'll let them know once they come back from prepping."
:mc_happy:"And I'll see you two tonight at the festival."
