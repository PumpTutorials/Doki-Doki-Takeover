:senpaihappy:What a lovely performance that was! I knew you had it in you.
:monikasad:Today has been one of the only real times I've tried to sing in front of strangers.
:monikauhohright:I'm glad that all the practice had paid off.
:senpaihappy:I quite liked the song choice as well. Where is it from?
:monikagasp:Oh! I... I wrote that song.
:monikagasp:It's something I spend a lot of long nights working on. It was meant for someone who means a lot to me.
:monikasad:Unfortunately... a lot happened, and I lost my chance to sing it to them... 
:monikagasp:I still don't know where I am now, so I don't know if I'll ever get to share it with them... 
:monikasad:-though I don't know if they'll even want to hear it.
:senpaihappy:Ah, such a tragic story you've found yourself entangled in.
:senpaihappy:I can promise that this place is one of no such tragedies.
:senpaihappy:I'll be around whenever you have a song in your heart that needs to be sang!
:monikagasp:(This guy is awfully flirtatious all of a sudden- especially after he snapped at me and that kid earlier...)
:monikasad:(Well. If I didn't end up here, it would've been the recycling bin instead...)
:monikasad:...
:monikasad:(I hope the others are okay.)
:monikasad:(Natsuki, Yuri, Sayori...)
:monikasad:(After what happened, I thought restoring their character files and leaving would be what's best for the club... and for the one I loved...)
:glitch:
:monikagasp:-!
:senpaihmm:Is something the matter?
:monikagasp:Ah- I'm fine. I don't know what that was-
